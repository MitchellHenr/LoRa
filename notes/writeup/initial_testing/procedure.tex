After all components have been connected as described, All that remains is to upload the source code.
The unit with the sensors attached is the client unit, and will therefore have the client code (\url{arduino/client/client.ino}) uploaded to it.
The other unit is the server unit, and will therefore have the server code (\url{arduino/server/server.ino}) uploaded to it.
This is the unit for which it is useful to have the serial monitor open, in order to verify that it is receiving data from the client unit.
