The purpose of this experiment was to examine the direct wireless communication between two devices with SX1276RF1KAS Transceivers and Arduino Uno boards.
For this experiment, no gateway was involved, so source code that allows direct communication between two nodes was used.
This experiment implemented an approach using SX1276RF1KAS Transceivers and Arduino Uno boards.
Communication was established between the two units before sensors were attached to the client unit, and the data from those sensors were sent to the server unit.
