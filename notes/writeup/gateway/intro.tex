The goal of this experiment was to establish communication between wireless transceivers and a wireless gateway.
This experiment implemented an approach using SX1276RF1KAS Transceivers and Arduino Uno boards, as well as a Multi-Tech Systems MultiConnect\textregistered\ Conduit\texttrademark\ gateway.
It connects the gateway and Arduino units to a network registered with \href{https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/}{The Things Network}.
